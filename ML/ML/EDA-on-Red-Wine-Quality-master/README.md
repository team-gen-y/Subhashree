My exploratory data analysis on the red wine quality dataset. 

This is the project of the course Data Analysis with R on Udacity.

Dataset information: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt

Please check the project3.Rmd file to look at the R code, and go to http://rpubs.com/swengzju/190719 to see the plots.

Updates:
EDA.Rmd is another short version, Predict_wine_quality.ipynb is the modeling part.
